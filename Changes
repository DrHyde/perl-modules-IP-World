releases by David Cantrell:

0.41  2020-10-12  Work-around for build failures with XCode 12

0.40  2019-01-11  MaxMind's GeoLite database has been discontinued,
                    so now only use WIPmania's data

0.39  2016-11-15  test jiggery-pokery to make sure stuff works once
                    . is removed from default @INC (see
                    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.workers/2016/11/msg1513.html)

0.38  2016-10-27  set User-Agent in maint_ip_world_db to cope with
                    Maxmind occasionally blocking LWP::UserAgent's
                    default UA. Maxmind are fine with this;
                  provide constants to use to set mode instead of
                    numbers (see https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=70687)

releases by Craig MacKenna:

0.37  Jul 3 2010
      * Corrected "number of tests to skip" in t/2mmap.t for systems 
        that don't have/implement mmap.

0.36  Jul 2 2010
      * i.r.t. RT bug #59056, modified maint_ip_world_db to check for 
        existence of IP::World::ConfigData before checking for a 
        datum inside it.
      * i.r.t. FAIL 07342895 on a test system with non-standard 
        versions of LWP::UserAgent and HTTP::Status, required at 
        least version 5.817 (Oct 2008) of both in Build.PL.
      * updated DB and revised tests per changes in IP space

0.35  Apr 26 2010
      * Included new ck_ip4 in World.xs, successor to inet_pton which 
        was mostly for Windows, in which Microsoft Visual Studio
        found C errors and warnings.
      * Changed mode in World.xs data file opening from "r" to "rb", 
        so that Windows will read the file in binary mode.  Maybe 
        someday this module will pass on Windows.

0.34  Apr 23 2010
      * Revised IP::World::Builder further to make databases writable 
        before changing their mod dates, on Windows.  Maybe someday 
        this module will pass on Windows.

0.33  Apr 12 2010
      * Removed all proxy handling except LWP::UserAgent env_proxy
        from maint_ip_world_db.  It was too ugly to fix.  A new module 
        will handle proxies in a future version.
      * Reconciled New vs. Newx call for perls < 5.8.8.
      * Added an implementation of inet_pton for Windows systems that
        don't include it.  It's only included/used on such systems.
      * Revised IP::World::Builder to make databases writable before
        changing their mod dates, on Windows.
      * Revised tests 4-8 in each test file to use quoted numeric
        constants.  This accomodates a weird cygwin test box that
        seemed to compile unquoted numeric constants as packed 32-bit 
        values(?).
      * Fixed a little problem in the ip2country script which was 
        contributed by a guy at WorldIP.

0.32  Apr 7 2010
      * Added some proxy handling to maint_ip_world_db.  Future
        versions will use a separate module for proxy handling.
      * Moved most of sub process_dat_files out of Build.PL, into
        IP/World/Builder.pm (known in perl as IP:World::Builder).
      * Moved 'use Probe::Perl' from test 0 to Build.PL.  Ensures
        that the automatic execution of maint_ip_world_db during the
        install phase happens under the perl used for the build.
      * Changed name of PERLIO pointer from IN.  IN had a conflict
        with something predefined on testers' Win32 systems.
      * Split former DASD mode 2 into mode 2 using C library I/O
        and mode 3 using Perl I/O.  Perl 5.10.1 seems to have slow
        Perl I/O.

0.2   Feb 22 2010
      * Fixed further problem in which the DESTROY function after
        new(1) on systems without the Mmap feature would do the wrong
        thing, resulting in segment-faults.

0.18  Feb 21 2010
      * Fixed problem in which new(1) on systems without Mmap feature
        wouldn't allocate memory, resulting in segment-faults on a
        subsequent getcc or DESTROY operation.
      * Fixed problem wherein C compiler name was compound.  Thanks
        to Stefan Rezic.
      * New included database, reflecting Feb update by WIPmania.
      * Minuscule improvement in maint_ip_world_db, in avoiding
        creation of a root-owned file in blib.

0.17  Feb 19 2010
      * Provided empty string as the 2nd (default) operand to the
        prompt() call in Build.PL, so that smoke-testers won't die
        with an UNKNOWN result.
      * Moved the execution of maint_ip_world_db from the build (code)
        phase to the install phase.  Main advantage is that tests
        will use an included database and so will not be subject to
        errors due to updating of the database by maint_ip_world_db.
      * Improved maint_ip_world_db to use a '.tmp' file for its output,
        then rename .dat->.bak, then .tmp->.dat.  This prevents
        destruction of the database by a run that encounters an error.
      * Added Probe::Perl to get the path to the current perl in
        t/0check_scripts.t
      * Changed t/0check_scripts.t to do a perl check of
        script/maint_ip_world_db, rather than a results check.
      * Added a way to preserve the mod time of the included databases
        through archiving and unpacking.

0.15  Feb 17 2010
      * Improved Build.PL to play better with Module::Build
      * Pre-built databases (big- and little-endian) are now included
        in the distribution, to allow installation without internet
        access, as well as speed up the installation as long as the
        included databases are recent enough not to need updating.
      * Added a -d or --dual switch to script/maint_ip_world_db, to
        produce both big- and little-endian databases in one run.
        (Mostly for the author in building new distributions.)

0.14  Feb 17 2010
      * Included ppport.h to maximize compatibility with older perls
      * Changed requires to perl 5.7.3
      * Small optimization to internal search loop in lib/IP/World.xs

0.13  Feb 16 2010
      * Updated Build.PL to make command line more compatible with
        non-Unix/Linux systems.
      * Updated script/maint_ip_world_db to improve the initial
        decision-making as to whether to build a database.
      * Updated t/0check_scripts.t to run perl syntax checks on
        script/ip_world_dump and script/ip_cc_benchmark.
      * Updated documentation in lib/IP/World.pod.

0.12  Feb 15 2010
      * Initial version: combines data from WorldIP and GeoIP
      * 3 modes: 0: fast, keeps data in memory
                 1: Mmap, fast, may save memory for forked children
                 2: tiny, slow but minimum memory, searches on disk
