Revision history for IP::World

0.15  Feb 17 2010
      * Improved Build.PL to play better with Module::Build
      * Pre-built databases (big- and little-endian) are now included 
        in the distribution, to allow installation without internet 
        access, as well as speed up the installation as long as the 
        included databases are recent enough not to need updating.
      * Added a -d or --dual switch to script/maint_ip_world_db, to 
        produce both big- and little-endian databases in one run.
        (Mostly for the author in building new distributions.)

0.14  Feb 17 2010
      * Included ppport.h to maximize compatibility with older perls
      * Changed requires to perl 5.7.3
      * Small optimization to internal search loop in lib/IP/World.xs

0.13  Feb 16 2010
      * Updated Build.PL to make command line more compatible with
        non-Unix/Linux systems.
      * Updated script/maint_ip_world_db to improve the initial
        decision-making as to whether to build a database.
      * Updated t/0check_scripts.t to run perl syntax checks on
        script/ip_world_dump and script/ip_cc_benchmark.
      * Updated documentation in lib/IP/World.pod.

0.12  Feb 15 2010
      * Initial version: combines data from WorldIP and GeoIP
      * 3 modes: 0: fast, keeps data in memory
                 1: Mmap, fast, may save memory for forked children
                 2: tiny, slow but minimum memory, searches on disk
