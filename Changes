Revision history for IP::World

0.19  Feb 22 2010
      * Fixed further problem in which the DESTROY function after 
        new(1) on systems without the Mmap feature would do the wrong 
        thing, resulting in segment-faults.

0.18  Feb 21 2010
      * Fixed problem in which new(1) on systems without Mmap feature
        wouldn't allocate memory, resulting in segment-faults on a
        subsequent getcc or DESTROY operation.
      * Fixed problem wherein C compiler name was compound.  Thanks 
        to Stefan Rezic.
      * New included database, reflecting Feb update by WIPmania.
      * Minuscule improvement in script/maint_ip_world_db, in avoiding 
        creation of a root-owned file in blib.

0.17  Feb 19 2010
      * Provided empty string as the 2nd (default) operand to the
        prompt() call in Build.PL, so that smoke-testers won't die
        with an UNKNOWN result.
      * Moved the execution of script/maint_ip_world_db from the 
        build (code) phase to the install phase.  Main advantage is
        that tests will use an included database and so will not be 
        subject to errors due to updating of the database by 
        script/maint_ip_world_db.
      * Improved script/maint_ip_world_db to use a '.tmp'file for its
        output, then rename the extensions .dat->.bak, then .tmp->.dat.  
        This prevents destruction of the database by a run that 
        encounters an error.
      * Added Probe::Perl to get the path to the current perl in 
        t/0check_scripts.t
      * Changed t/0check_scripts.t to do a perl check of 
        script/maint_ip_world_db, rather than a results check.
      * Added a way to preserve the mod time of the included databases
        through archiving and unpacking.

0.15  Feb 17 2010
      * Improved Build.PL to play better with Module::Build
      * Pre-built databases (big- and little-endian) are now included
        in the distribution, to allow installation without internet
        access, as well as speed up the installation as long as the
        included databases are recent enough not to need updating.
      * Added a -d or --dual switch to script/maint_ip_world_db, to
        produce both big- and little-endian databases in one run.
        (Mostly for the author in building new distributions.)

0.14  Feb 17 2010
      * Included ppport.h to maximize compatibility with older perls
      * Changed requires to perl 5.7.3
      * Small optimization to internal search loop in lib/IP/World.xs

0.13  Feb 16 2010
      * Updated Build.PL to make command line more compatible with
        non-Unix/Linux systems.
      * Updated script/maint_ip_world_db to improve the initial
        decision-making as to whether to build a database.
      * Updated t/0check_scripts.t to run perl syntax checks on
        script/ip_world_dump and script/ip_cc_benchmark.
      * Updated documentation in lib/IP/World.pod.

0.12  Feb 15 2010
      * Initial version: combines data from WorldIP and GeoIP
      * 3 modes: 0: fast, keeps data in memory
                 1: Mmap, fast, may save memory for forked children
                 2: tiny, slow but minimum memory, searches on disk
